# Blockchain Project Proposal
 
## Summary  
The goal of this project is to create a private Ethereum network within WWT which users
will be able to interact (mine ether) and exchange for WWT tokens.  Users will also be able to deploy a smart contract written in solidity and interact with it via node and a web application and complete a survey form to earn WWT tokens.  

Currently capabilities are only to set up a local network on the same machine and have nodes interact  
 
There will be two major goals of this project.  
1.  Set up a private Ethereum blockchain with a genesis block and create the capability for other  
users/clients within the WWT network to connect to this blockchain and run a full node and mine
ether.  (The ether will have no real value but can be used to convert to WWT tokens - point 2)
2. Deploy a WWT token smart contract to the network. (The ultimate goal of the WWT token is to be a rewards system
within the WWT community, however for this project users will just be able to earn, give and receive tokens)  
3. Create a web application that can interact with smart contract so users will earn tokens when they complete a survey  
 
Users with certain amount off WWTs token could potentially exchange them for  
Discounted or Free WWT/Application Services apparel  
extra study/learning days  
extra vacation  
 
Users could earn WWT tokens with various behaviors such as  
mining ether within the private blockchain  
filling out survey forms sent via WWT  
donating your time to charitable causes  
participating in hackathons  
Etc.  
 
For this project I hope to set up a system where users who mine ether in our network will be able to exchange them for WWT tokens.  Users can interact with web application complete survey and earn tokens  
Most of the bullet points above are just food for thought and could be implemented in the future.
